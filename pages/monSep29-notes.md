- # Major Topics
- ### 1. Encapsulation
	- Writing general classes with fields, properties, methods, and constructors
	- Creating and using objects
- ### 2. Properties
	- When a private backing field is needed
	- Enforcing bounds
	-
	- Accessors and derived properties
- ### 3. Interfaces
	- Declaring and implementing interfaces
	- Why and when to use them
- ### 4. Inheritance
	- Refactoring to create base and child classes
	- Extending a class
	- What is inherited
	- `virtual` and `override` keywords
	- How constructors work
	- Why inheritance is useful
- ### 5. Abstract Classes
	- Declaring and extending
	- What is inherited
	- Abstract vs. virtual methods
	- How they differ from interfaces
- ### 6. Unit Testing
- `[Fact]` and `[Theory]`
- Designing effective test cases
- Assertions:
	- `Assert.Equal`
	- `Assert.Contains`
	- `Assert.IsType<T>`
	- `Assert.IsAssignableFrom<T>`
	- `Assert.True` / `Assert.False`
- Using mock objects
- ### 7. UML Diagrams
- Interpreting and drawing UML diagrams
- Include **all members** (private, protected, etc.)
- Associations:
	- **Realization** (implements interface): dashed line, arrow toward interface
	- **Aggregation/Composition** (collection of objects): diamond on collection side, multiplicities (`1`, `0..*`, or specific number)
	- **Generalization** (extends a class): arrow toward base class
- Marking details:
	- Properties: `<<get, init>>` (no need to show bounds or defaults)
	- Static: underline
	- Abstract: italicize
	- Inherited members: only show members defined in that class
