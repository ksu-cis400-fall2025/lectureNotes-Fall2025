# CIS400: Object-oriented design, implementation, and testing
_Jorge Valenzuela_

- One project for the entire semester
    - Milestones
    - Focus in three main different areas
    - Using WPF—learning curve
        - Use in the industry
        - ASP.NET, web forms, and LINQ
    - Show the project from previous semester
        - Give them a sense of what they will be doing
    - This semester is for "Sub Hero" (customizable sandwiches—kinda like Subway)
        - Part 1
        - Part 2
        - Part 3

## Structure of the class

- Hybrid class
    - Divided in modules
        - Reading
        - Maybe a quiz (not part of the final grade)
        - 2 Video tutorials
        - **New milestone** — Due Fridays
    - Class time
        - **Mondays**: Lecture/Recitation (talk about milestone)
        - **Wednesdays**: If something is left to talk about current milestone, get help if needed
        - **Fridays**: Help time
    - Software needed:
        - VS 2022 (disable IntelliCode/Copilot) (Show how to turn it off)
        - Visio for UML or other UML tool (DrawIO)
        - IntelliSense is fine
    - Mac Users... (what was she going to say?)
    - Lab machines have all the tools
- Syllabus
    - Exams (2 midterms, 1 optional final): **35%** — calculated using top 2 exams
    - Milestones (about 12): **50%**
    - Tutorials: **15%**
    - Address bordering grades
- Class policy
    - Because each milestone is built based on the previous one
        - 10% off each day late, down to a 40%
        - Exams mark two cut-off points, after these dates no late work is accepted
    - I do not give incompletes
    - No AI-generated code or IntelliCode
- Get help
    - First, class
    - Office hours
    - ED Discussions (I will look at during business hours)
        - Small code snippets are okay
        - Helping hand category in Canvas
        - A lot of code—publish private
    - Each week's module is posted Friday previous week
    - Extra credit: **Bug Bounty**
- Discussion and Activity of current knowledge
    - Field vs Property
    - Constructor
        - Default constructor
- Relevant C# things for each milestone

## Friday, August 24, 2025

- Go over Git commands (run `git status` every time)
    - `git clone`
    - Make a branch
    - `git checkout <branch>`
    - `git add`
    - `git commit`
    - `git checkout main`
    - `git merge`
    - `git push`
- Common errors:
    - Forget to save
    - Forget to commit
    - Forget to push
    - Forget to check what branch you are in
