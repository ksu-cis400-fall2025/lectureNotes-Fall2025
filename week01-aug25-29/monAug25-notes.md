# CIS400: Object-oriented design, implementation, and testing
_Jorge Valenzuela_

- One project for the entire semester
    - Milestones
    - Focus in three main different areas
    - Using WPF—learning curve
        - Use in the industry
        - ASP.NET, web forms, and LINQ
    - Show the project from previous semester
        - Give them a sense of what they will be doing
    - This semester is for "Sub Hero" (customizable sandwiches—kinda like Subway)
        - Part 1: develop menu using object-oriented design principles
        - Part 2: write point of sale WPF application for restaurant
        - Part 3: create website for restaurant using ASP.NET

## Structure of the class

- Hybrid class
    - Divided in modules
        - Reading
        - Maybe a quiz (not part of the final grade, but recommended!)
        - 2 Video tutorials (will start next week - due Mon/Tues)
        - **New milestone** — for the semester-long project (Due Fridays)
    - Class time
        - **Mondays**: Lecture/Recitation (talk about milestone)
        - **Wednesdays**: If something is left to talk about current milestone, get help if needed
        - **Fridays**: Help time
    - Software needed:
        - VS 2022 - or later- (disable IntelliCode/Copilot) (Show how to turn it off)
        - Visio for UML or other UML tool (DrawIO)
        - IntelliSense is fine
    - Windows - you can get a free version. (show how)(https://www.cs.ksu.edu/student-success/resources/)
    - Mac Users... (come to see me if you need help)
    - Lab machines should have all the tools
- Syllabus
    - Exams (2 midterms, 1 optional final): **35%** — calculated using top 2 exams
    - Milestones (about 12): **50%**
    - Tutorials: **15%**
    - Address bordering grades
- Class policy
    - Because each milestone is built based on the previous one
        - 10% off each day late, down to a 40%
        - Exams mark two cut-off points, after these dates no late work is accepted
    - I do not give incompletes
    - No AI-generated code or IntelliCode
- Get help
    - First, class
    - Office hours
    - ED Discussions (I will look at during business hours)
        - Small code snippets are okay
        - Helping hand category in Canvas
        - A lot of code—publish private
    - Each week's module is posted Friday previous week
    - Extra credit: **Bug Bounty**
- THIS week:
    - Milestone 0 due Fri (finish reading / quiz beforehand!)
        - practice milestone process (git, create release)
        - PLUS, post on Ed Discussion (can do this now)
- Discussion and Activity of current knowledge
    - Field vs Property
    - Constructor
        - Default constructor
